## WHAT'S MOST URGENT

1. Client reviews — fake ones look sketchy, need real ones first
2. Portfolio details — page is empty without project info
3. Company info check — wrong phone/email means lost leads
4. About page — mission, vision, values
5. Everything else can wait

Just fill this out and send it back. I'll plug everything in.
